# CMTAT + ICMA Tokenized Fixed Income Platform

A comprehensive demonstration platform showcasing the integration of **CMTAT (Capital Markets and Technology Association) v3.0** framework with **ICMA Bond Data Taxonomy v1.2** for tokenized fixed income securities.

## üè¶ About

This project was developed by **Sivasubramanian Ramanathan**, former Product Owner at the **Bank for International Settlements (BIS)**. Having worked extensively in central banking and financial infrastructure, I became deeply curious about emerging standards in tokenized finance, particularly:

- **ICMA Bond Data Taxonomy (BDT)** - The industry standard for bond data classification
- **CMTAT Framework** - Ethereum-based token standard for compliant securities
- **MAS Project Guardian** - Singapore's DeFi experimentation framework
- **Global Layer 1 Guardian Fixed Income Framework** - Cross-border tokenized securities infrastructure

This platform demonstrates how these standards can work together to create a production-ready tokenized fixed income trading environment.
